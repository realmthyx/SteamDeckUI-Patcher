With these installed let's go to the next step.

# Does it work with Python2?
Bro that thing is old the syntax is old it's written in 𝓜𝓸𝓭𝓮𝓻𝓷 𝓟𝔂𝓽𝓱𝓸𝓷 3.

# Is this python file a virus?
No, it isn't. It doesn't do anything malicious.

# Showcase?
https://youtu.be/ZCx6KMfzkss <- here you go.

# Is it any better than SteamOS?

This is more of like a launcher wrapper, while SteamOS is a Linux distribution I really can't say if it is any better than SteamOS. 
But it's good for people that prefers playing on controllers without a hassle installing modded SteamOS, definitely try this out!
But if you REALLY want this Steam Deck experience, search up how to install SteamOS 3.0 on Any PC.
This will give you a minimal experience of the GUI itself. Treat it like a semi-emulator XD.

# If I go to Power and click Turn Off will it turn off Steam or the entire PC?

Entire PC. You can just click "X" in the window and Steam will close.
By clicking Turn Off in the Power section will shut down your entire computer, not reccomending it if you have unsaved work.

# Can I make projects using this Patcher?

Most definitely YES! If you can make like a video that you can make a unused gaming PC and want to give it a second life as a console. Yes!
If you make projects like this or any videos using this patcher you must credit me (czarro1337) and give the link to the GitHub Page.

# Summary.

Thank you for downloading my patcher, it really took like 1 hour to write this script with minor bugs and errors fixed. Hope you will like it!

And please do not spam me with issues like it doesnt work on py2 or blah blah just dont.
